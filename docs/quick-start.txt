Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to create and configure Laravel web application
and the {+odm-long+} to use a MongoDB cluster hosted on MongoDB Atlas as the
database from a command line-based development environment.

.. tip::

   If you prefer to set up your development environment in GitHub Codespaces 
   or Docker, see the linked code repository in the
   `How to Build a Laravel + MongoDB Back End Service <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/php/laravel-mongodb-tutorial/>`__
   MongoDB Developer Center tutorial.

   If you prefer to connect to MongoDB by using the PHP Library driver without
   Laravel, see `Connecting to MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/tutorial/connecting/>`__
   in the PHP Library documentation.

{+odm-short+} extends the Laravel Eloquent and Query Builder syntax to
store and retrieve data from MongoDB.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your
MongoDB deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card
required) MongoDB Atlas deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow the steps in this guide to create a sample Laravel web application
that connects to a MongoDB deployment.

.. tip::

   You can download the complete web application project by cloning the
   `laravel-quickstart <https://github.com/mongodb-university/laravel-quickstart>`__
   GitHub repository.
