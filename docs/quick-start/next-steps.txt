Congratulations on completing the quick start tutorial!

After you complete these steps, you have a Laravel web application that
uses the {+odm-long+} to connect to your MongoDB deployment, run a query on
the sample data, and render a retrieved result.

In this tutorial, you created a Laravel web application that uses the
{+odm-long+} to connect to your MongoDB deployment, render the result
of a query, and write data to a MongoDB deployment hosted on
MongoDB Atlas.

Learn more about {+odm-short+} features from the following resources:

- :ref:`laravel-eloquent-models`: use Eloquent model classes to work
  with MongoDB data.

- :ref:`laravel-query-builder`: use the query builder to specify MongoDB
  queries and aggregations.
